To make a booking, select the arrival and departure time from a set of available time slots. The booking details are displayed in the banner above the booking date. Click confirm to proceed to the next step for finalising the booking.

## Step 3.

Finalise the booking by filling in the details on the form and submit by clicking "Confirm Booking". A 15 minute change-over period will be appended to the start and end of the booking (indicated in orange) to ensure that the bay will be available for the next guest.
